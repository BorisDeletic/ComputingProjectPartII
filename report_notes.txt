* Explain code structure, class choices
* Discuss generating random numbers for MC simulation - rand vs mersenne twister - speed considerations
* Parallelisation of multiple sims, not one lattice.
* How we calculate equilibrium
* Why chose C++ over python.
* Double steps everytime equilibrium not reached.

* We get higher Tc for non random initial lattice
* iterative algorithm seems to give same answers as MC, just faster (verify) and more reliable
* Note spontaneous symmetry breaking for randomised initial lattice
